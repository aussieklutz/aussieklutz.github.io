Well, back to blog writing and getting ready for a new big season of SecCons...

We are in the middle of a period of rapid fire hacker cons in Australia, starting with a drought breaking [BSidesBNE 2020](http://web.archive.org/web/20201210065008/https://bsidesbrisbane.com/) on a very delayed 12-12-2020, into [CrikeyCon VII](https://www.crikeycon.com/)[/TODO: Permalink/] this coming Saturday, 06-03-2021, and a  few more this side of the year:

- [BSidesBNE 2021](https://bsidesbrisbane.com/) - 03-06-2021
- [BSidesCanbera 2021](https://www.bsidesau.com.au/) - 09-04-2021

By all indications this is looking like a golden time to be in infosec in Australia, with con-life going strong. Bring on the talks, hacks and good times - and hack all the things.

Addendum:
I know that some other events have also occurred during this time period, however at the time of writing I couldn't confirm details. A notable example is TuskCon which nominally was postponed from 2020 to February, however the site does not provide much clarity on this point.
